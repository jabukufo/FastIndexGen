Tool for HaloOnline ms23 which adds empty cfgt tags to the end of tags.dat MUCH faster than using duplicate command in TagTool. I wanted to add this as a TagTool command, but haven't been able to figure out how to get it to write to tags.dat... Since TagTool has tags.dat open. Feel free to add my code to TagTool if you can get it working.
